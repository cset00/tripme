Trip Me - Melbourne
https://tripme-melb.herokuapp.com/

Ever run out of ideas or things to do for the weekend? Why not go on a trip?!

This app will randomise a trip with a list of activities you can do (places to see, food and drinks to consume, hikes to challenge yourself with and so on..)

The idea is you should be able to specify a preferred location and whether you'd like a sweet & romantic getaway with your partner, an outdoor adventure with friends, a fun-filled weekend with the family, or a work function weekend.. You get the idea! (feature coming soon).

For now, you'll get a simple random list of activities for a random location, which you can save if you like. If you don't like the trip generated, you can keep going and get a different list.

Alternatively, you could browse from the list of activities (sort by popularity, recency, and distance from Melbourne also coming soon)
